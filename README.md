# Coding Duels

*Coding Duels* is a framework which allows programmers to battle each other with their programs. Each human participant writes his/her own mini artificial intelligence (AI). Then all of the AIs are plugged into the *Coding Duels* framework, where they compete in whatever challenge they're programmed for.

## Getting Started

This will eventually contain instructions for getting started with *Coding Duels*.

## Versioning

*Coding Duels* follows a [major].[minor].[patch] versioning scheme. Below are some basic guidelines to follow when incrementing the version number:

* For bug fixes, small updates, adding AIs, etc, increment [patch] number.
* When new games are added to the framework or when relatively large changes are made, increment [minor].
* Only increment [major] for extremely large/extensive updates.
